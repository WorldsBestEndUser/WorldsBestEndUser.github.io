                Currently supporting the organization as a member of the Data Acquisition team. Primary responsibilities previously included daily collection and processing of data from various sources, monitoring for processing errors and troubleshooting as needed, and researching and analyzing reported discrepancies in stored data via SQL Server. Most recently, I have been assisting with migration from our legacy data processing system to a new platform by evaluating raw source data for migration feasibility, designing field mapping plans, and creating documentation for our team’s process enhancement initiative.
